<h1>Code of Conduct<a class="headerlink" href="#code-of-conduct" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Status:</span> <span class="pre">Draft</span></code></p>
<p>We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic.</p>
<p>We’ve written this code of conduct not because we expect bad behaviour from our community—which, in our experience, is overwhelmingly kind and civil—but because we believe a clear code of conduct is one necessary part of building a respectful community space.</p>
<p>We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.</p>
<p>Please be kind and courteous. There’s no need to be mean or rude. Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer, merely an optimal answer given a set of values and circumstances.</p>
<p>Our open community strives to:</p>
<p><strong>Be friendly and patient</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Be considerate</strong>: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we’re a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.</p>
<p><strong>Be respectful</strong>: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to impact others. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.</p>
<p><strong>Be careful in the words that we choose</strong>: we are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour aren’t acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Try to understand why we disagree</strong>: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>What goes around comes a round</strong>. We believe in open source, and are excited by what happens when people add value to each others work in a collaborative way.</p>
<p><strong>Take care of each other</strong>. Alert a member of the project team if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.</p>
<p>If any participants engages in harassing behaviour, the project team may take any lawful action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to warning the offender or asking the offender to leave the project.</p>
<div class="section" id="diversity-statement">
<h2>Diversity Statement<a class="headerlink" href="#diversity-statement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.</p>

<div class="section" id="reporting-issues">
<h2>Reporting Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#reporting-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>NOTE: no contact has yet been decided</p>
<p>If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour—or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting us via [TODO] All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Your contact information.</li>
<li>Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public slack channel), please include a link.</li>
<li>Any additional information that may be helpful.</li>
</ul>
<p>After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.</p>
